# Plant-NoteKeeping
Organizer to keep track when plants were last watered!

## Keep track when your plants have been watered!

Why I made this app?
I made this app because I never knew where to keep track of my plants water schedule. 
My real life calendar got too cluttered, and I needed a better way of keeping track.
